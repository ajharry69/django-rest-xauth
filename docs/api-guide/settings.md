# Settings
You can customize the `django-rest-xauth` default behaviour by providing `XAUTH` setting in your django project's
`settings.py` file like below.

```python
XAUTH = {
    'TOKEN_EXPIRY': timedelta(days=60),
    'AUTO_HASH_PASSWORD_ON_SAVE': True,
    'ENFORCE_ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION': True,
    ...,
}
```

**NOTE:** All `XAUTH` setting names must be written in **capital letters(uppercase)** for a setting to take effect.

## SERIALIZER_CLASSES
**Type:** `dict`

**Default:** None

**Usage:** Updates `request` and `response` serializer classes for `profile` and `signup` views.

## APP_NAME
**Type**: `str`

**Default**: project name [python-capitalized][python-capitalize]

**Usage**: occasionally included in emails sent by the API to your users as a source identity

## TOKEN_KEY
**Type**: `str`

**Default**: `SECRET_KEY` provided by django during project creation

**Usage**: for token signing

## TOKEN_EXPIRY
**Type**: `timedelta`

**Default**: `timedelta(days=60)`

## VERIFICATION_CODE_EXPIRY
**Type**: `timedelta`

**Default**: `timedelta(hours=1)`

**Usage**: period within which an account verification code and token(verification) should be considered valid.

**Note:** if you have `xauth.authentication.JWTTokenAuthentication` as the first option in `REST_FRAMEWORK`'s
`DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES` in your settings, this token will not be usable for any other purpose other than account verification
through the endpoint provided by `VERIFICATION_ENDPOINT` in `XAUTH` settings.

## TEMPORARY_PASSWORD_EXPIRY
**Type**: `timedelta`

**Default**: `timedelta(minutes=30)`

**Usage**: period within which a password-reset temporary password and token(generated when password reset is requested)
 should be considered valid.

**Note:** if you have `xauth.authentication.JWTTokenAuthentication` as the first option in `REST_FRAMEWORK`'s
`DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES` in your settings, this token will not be usable for any other purpose other than password-reset through the
endpoint provided by `PASSWORD_RESET_ENDPOINT` in `XAUTH` settings.

## ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_TOKEN_EXPIRY
**Type**: `timedelta`

**Default**: `timedelta(days=1)`

**Usage**: period within which an account activation token(generated when account activation is requested after
deactivation) should be considered valid.

**Note:** if you have `xauth.authentication.JWTTokenAuthentication` as the first option in `REST_FRAMEWORK`'s
`DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES` in your settings, this token will not be usable for any other purpose other than
account activation through the endpoint provided by `ACTIVATION_ENDPOINT` in `XAUTH` settings.

## REPLY_TO_ACCOUNTS_EMAIL_ADDRESSES
**Type**: `list`

**Default**: `[ settings.EMAIL_HOST_USER, ]`. `settings` is from `django.conf.setting` module

**Usage**: email address(es) to which replies of emails sent(account verification and password reset) to users through
the `django-rest-xauth` should be channelled.

## ACCOUNTS_EMAIL

**Default**: `settings.EMAIL_HOST_USER`. `settings` is from `django.conf.setting` module

**Usage**: email address for sending (verification codes and temporary password e.t.c.) from `django-rest-xauth`.

## VERIFICATION_CODE_LENGTH
**Type**: `int`

**Default**: `6`

**Usage**: determines the length of the generated verification code(sent to user) to be used for account verification.

## TEMPORARY_PASSWORD_LENGTH
**Type**: `int`

**Default**: `8`

**Usage**: determines the length of the generated temporary password(sent to user) to be used for password reset.

## NEWBIE_VALIDITY_PERIOD
**Type**: `timedelta`

**Default**: `timedelta(days=1)`

**Usage**: period within which a user will be considered new from the time of account creation.

## POST_REQUEST_USERNAME_FIELD
**Type**: `str`

## MAXIMUM_SIGN_IN_ATTEMPTS
**Type**: `int`

**Default**: `0`

less means no limit should be enforced hence no account deactivation due to sign-in attempts limit.

## USER_LOOKUP_FIELD
**Type**: `str`

**Default**: `pk`. Should be one of `xauth.models.User` **unique** [fields][user-model-fields-url] e.g. 'pk', 'id',
'username' e.t.c

**Usage**: used together with [PROFILE_ENDPOINT][profile-endpoint-setting-url] setting to build up a single user profile
hence a change to either setting would require a change on the other as they are mutually inclusive.

## PROFILE_ENDPOINT
**Type**: `str`

**Default**: `profile/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)/`

**Usage**: used together with [USER_LOOKUP_FIELD][user-lookup-field-setting-url] setting to build up a single user profile
hence a change to either setting would require a change on the other as they are mutually inclusive.

## VERIFICATION_ENDPOINT
**Type**: `str`

**Default**: `verification/confirm/`

**Usage**: used to create a url through which account verification code should be verified/validated for correctness
before account is considered verified.

## PASSWORD_RESET_ENDPOINT
**Type**: `str`

**Default**: `password/reset/confirm/`
